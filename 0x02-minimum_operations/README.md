# 0x03-minimum_operations

## ALX Interview
For this interview practice algorithm, there is a text file with a single character.  The text editor can only execute two operations: Copy All and Paste.

[0. Minimum Operations](./0-minoperations.py)
* Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operation needed to result in exactly `n` characters in the file.
  * Example: `n` = 9
    * H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
    * Number of operations = 6
  * `n` is the number of times the character should be repeated.
  * returns the fewest number of operations needed or 0 if n is impossible
