## ALX Interview

[0. Island Perimeter](./0-island_perimeter.py)

 Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

* grid is a list of list of integers:
	- 0 represents water
	- 1 represents land
	- Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
	- Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
	- grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
* The grid is completely surrounded by water
* There is only one island (or nothing).
* The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
